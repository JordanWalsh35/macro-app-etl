                financial system, including cash, easily accessible funds, and credit. It represents the capacity of the economy to finance transactions, investments, and economic activity. High liquidity means there is ample money 
                and credit available, which generally supports asset prices, business expansion, and consumer spending. Conversely, low liquidity indicates tight financial conditions, often leading to higher borrowing costs, 
                reduced investment, and potential stress in financial markets. Because liquidity is a fundamental driver of economic cycles and market performance, monitoring its levels and trends is crucial for understanding potential 
                shifts in financial conditions and the broader economy.""")
